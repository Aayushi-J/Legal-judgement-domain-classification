# Legal-judgement-domain-classification


A comprehensive study was undertaken, involving the collection of judgments from diverse courts across India. The primary objective was to examine the possibility of classifying these judgments based on predefined labels. The analysis delved into discerning intricate patterns within the data, exploring whether autonomous segregation into distinct clusters could be achieved by machine learning algorithms, even without explicit labels. This project highlighted proficiency in legal informatics, data analysis, and the application of machine learning to intricate legal datasets.
